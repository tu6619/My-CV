# Thomas Upton - Curriculum Vitae

Since taking my first coding steps in October of 2015, I have delighted in finding a pursuit that challenges me on a daily basis. Software development requires a high level of patience whilst dealing with time pressures. Team work and effective communication are paramount in staying productive within a workflow based on continuous integration. I found it useful drawing on skills afforded to me by
a higher education in French, Spanish and International Relations. While at the University of Bristol and since graduating in 2012, I have taken every opportunity to work in fields I feel passionately about. These include a language teacher, an ACIS Tour Manager, a language program manager, a teaching resource developer, a music producer and [performer](www.savaggio.com). Understanding the mechanics of functional and object-orientated programming, logic and full-stack application development with the support of the community at Founders & Coders has and continues to be a real pleasure. My aim is to remain focussed on code craft and to keep pushing myself beyond my current capabilities.
